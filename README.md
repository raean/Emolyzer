This is a set of Python functions and scripts that aid in the process of getting Last.FM user listening history, web-crawling lyrics of the songs using Genius and scoring them using emotional and sentiment analysis. The output is a .CSV with the song names, artist names, lyrics, url of the lyrics and the scoring proportions!
